# What is Docker Trying to Fix?

### 1. Trying to fix Installation Errors and Remove unexpected behavior

- Installating Software:
	- Download installer
	- Run installer
	- **ERROR**: Get an error message during installation
	- Troubleshoot issue
	- Rerun installer
	- **ERROR**: Get another error!

### 2. Why use Docker?

- Docker makes it really easy to install and run software without worrying about setup or dependencies.
